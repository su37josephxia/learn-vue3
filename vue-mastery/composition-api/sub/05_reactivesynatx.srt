1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,480
 until now we've been using reactive references to declare all of our reactive properties
到目前为止，我们一直在使用响应式引用来声明我们所有的响应式属性

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:15,620
however the composition syntax comes with another equally valid way declare reactive properties
然而，复合API语法有另一个同样有效的方法去响应式的声明一些属性

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,760
which I want to show you now
我现在就给你秀一下

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,560
 use it instead of reactive references first we need to import  be ractive
使用reactive代替reactive reference 首先我们要先引入reactive

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,620
 I will create an event constant and called the reactive function
创建一个event常量，称为响应式函数

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
 it returns a reactive object
它返回一个响应式对象

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,680
send in an object with each of the properties that we want to be reactive
派发一个对象，其中包含我们想要的每个属性

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,120
 notice here it even contains our computed property
注意这里它甚至包含了我们的计算属性

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,460
 this might feel a little more familiar since we're used to declaring
我们可能有点熟悉,因为我们过去常常用option API 的data来声明我们的响应式对象

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,520
 reactive object using our data option


11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,800
 we are doing here is taking a reactive references
我们在这里做的是响应式而不是

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,820
 instead declaring them in an object
在对象里面声明它们

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,880
 you should notice that inside of her computed property
你应该能发现在computed属性 

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,180
 I no longer have to use dot value
不再使用.value 了

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,720
since our object is taking care of reactivity
因为我们考虑的是响应式

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,460
Then we'll declare a method
然后我们会声明一个方法

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,140
again we don't have to use dot value 
我们也不会使用.value

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,060
we can just say event dot capacity plus plus
我们可以写event.capacity++

19
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,100
 and lastly notice I can send the entire event object
最后请注意，我可以派发整个事件对象

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,180
 into the template
返回到模板中

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,500
Both of these are completely valid syntaxes
这两种语法完全都是有效的

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,420
It's up to you which one you use
取决你想选择哪一种

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,340
our template is going to look a little different
我们的模板看起来会有点不同

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,920
 here we have to specify event dot event dot event dot
这里我们必须指定event.dot

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,100
to access the properties on this reactive object
去访问这个对象上的属性

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,800
I saw this code I kinda of didn't like it
当我看到这段代码的时候我不太喜欢这样

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,800
like, I wanted to be able to destructure
比如说,我想破坏结构

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,800
that event object into pieces so that 
这个event对象变成了一段一段的

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,800
in my template I didn't have to say event dot
在我的模板中, 我不得不使用event.dot

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,840
 I really wondered if I could destruction this event object so my template
我真的很想知道我是否可以破坏这个事件对象的结构，这样我的template

31
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,660
 didn't have to have a event on
就没有点了

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,380
 now that i've changed my template it wouldn't currently work
现在我已经改变了我的template，它目前不起作用

33
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,120
To make this work I would have to change how I'm returning the event
为了让这个起作用,我不得不返回这个事件

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,620
 my first guess
我的第一个猜测

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,080
 it's just to use dot dot dot however that didn't work
使用...去结构 但是没用

36
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,520
 second guess was simply to list out each of the properties
第二个猜测是简单地列出每个属性

37
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,840
but also error out
但是也错了

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,440
problem here is that splitting apart the event object is going to remove its reactivity
问题是拆分event会使响应式消失

39
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
 it's not going to work
这是行不通的

40
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,040
The solution here is to take
解决方案是

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:23,400
to take our reactive object split each object up into its own reactive references
把我们的响应式对象拆分成一个一个的reactive ref

42
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Luckily,Vue3.0 come with a function called toRef
幸运的是,vue3.0附带了一个函数叫toRef

43
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,760
So I'll import it
我会引入

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,140
and then if I send event into this function
如果我把事件发送到这个函数

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,460
 it's going to convert my reactive object 
它会改变我的响应式对象

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,840 into a plain object
 each property being a reactive reference
每个属性都是响应式引用

47
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,220
that points to the property on the original object
指向原始对象的属性

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,720
I do a mention though but if I didn't need to expose increase capacity
不过我还是想提一下如果我不需要让capacity++

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
 my template
我的模板

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,080
 I could instead simply write
我可以直接写

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,200
toRefs event
return toRefs(event) 

52
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,500
And I wouldn't need to destructure it
我不需要去解构event

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,340
 simply returning a plain object
直接return一个对象

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,140
 which is what our setup function
这就是我们的setup功能

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,020
 is expected to return
被return回来
