You're probably already familiar with 
你可能已经熟悉了

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,200
the Vue LifeCycle methods
Vue的生命周期

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,240
like beforeCreate
像 beforeCreate

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,620
created


5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,020
beforeMount


6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,400
mounted 


7
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
beforeUpdate


8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,680
updated


9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,100
beforeDestroy and destroyed


10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,040
if you're not familiar with these 
如果你不熟悉这些

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:21,860
pause the video, read the descriptions
停止看这个视频,看官方文档

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,000
Moving on
然后我们继续

13
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
There's some additional Vue2.0 LifeCycle methods 
还有一些Vue2.0其他的生命周期的方法

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
which were released in recent versions 
在最新发布的版本中

15
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:27,999
I want to make sure you're familiar with
为了确认你熟悉(在这里说一下)

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,840
The first is activated
第一个是activated

17
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,300
This is used when you have dynamic components
当您有动态组件时会用到它

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,560
using <keep-alive></keep-alive>
使用<keep-alive></keep-alive>

19
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,320
when the component inside <keep-alive> is toggled on
当<keep-alive>里面的组件激活时被触发

20
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,020
Then there is deactivated
还有一个是deactivated

21
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,100
when the component inside <keep-alive> is toggled off
被<keep-alive>缓存的组件停用时调用

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,900
And errorCaptured
还有errorCaptured

23
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,720
This is called when an error
会在后代组件中错误被捕获时调用

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,120
from any descendant component is captured
会在后代组件中错误被捕获时调用

25
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,000
If you want to learn more about how these work   
如果想了解更多细节

26
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,960
check out the documentation
还得好好看文档

27
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,800
let's now dive into changes with Vue3.0
但是现在请让我们了解Vue3.0的变化

28
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,780
First off,beforeDestroy LifeCycle Method
首先，生命周期beforeDestroy

29
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,740
can also be written as beforeUnmount
也可以写成beforeUnmount

30
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,880
Both should work
两个作用是一样的

31
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,620
Also destroyed you can also use unmounted
同样的destroyed，也可以用unmounted

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,300
These should both work with Vue3.0 
这两种生命周期都可以用到Vue3.0

33
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,300
and when I asked Evan You why this change
我问过小右为什么这么改

34
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,160
it's pretty much because it's a better naming convention
这在很大程度上是为了更好的命名约定

35
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,380
We mount the component and we unmount components
我们挂载组件并且我们卸载组件

36
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,480
When we're using the Composition API
当我们使用Composition API

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and we need LifeCycle methods
且需要用到生命周期方法

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,900
We simply add "on" to the callback name 
我们只需要在生命周期前面添加"on"

39
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,200
inside the setup method
在setup内部

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,420
So here's what that might look like 
所以会变成什么样呢

41
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,420
for beforeMount and onMounted
对于beforeMount和onMounted

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,780
We need to import them and then we can simply use them
我们只需要引入这些生命周期就可以使用

43
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,420
sending in anonymous functions inside of our setup method
在setup方法内部的匿名函数里也可以

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,520
Here's list of all the different LifeCycle methods
这是所有生命周期方法不同点的列表

45
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,620
we can use inside the setup method
我们可以在setup方法内部使用

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
if you're being observant
如果你细心观察

47
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,320
you might notice that two are missing
你可能注意到有两个不见了

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,360
beforeCreate and created are not needed 
当我们使用composition API时beforeCreate和created不需要了

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
when we're using the composition API
当我们使用composition API时beforeCreate和created不需要了

50
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,010
and we have that setup method
我们有setup方法

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
this is because beforeCreate is called right before setup
这是因为beforeCreate在setup之前就被调用了

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,520
(译者注：实测不是这样，setup早于beforeCreate和created)

55
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,560
and then created is called right after setup
然后created在setup之后被调用

56
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,620

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,880
 code that would normally be put inside of these hooks
通常放在这些钩子中的代码

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,580
 now being placed inside of our setup method
现在被放置在我们的setup方法内部

59
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,060
 example here would be AP calls
这里的例子是AP调用

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,620
 we put those inside of beforeCreate or created and instead
我们把它们从beforeCreate或created

61
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,480
 you can call them from our setup method
移至setup内部调用

62
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,440
 are two new vue3 lifecycle methods the first of which is on renderTracked
vue3还有两个新的生命周期方法，其中一个是renderTracked

63
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,100
 this is called when a reactive dependency is first being accessed in the render function during render
该钩子会在渲染函数首次访问响应式依赖的时候调用

64
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,980
 meaning this dependency will now be
意味着这个依赖现在

65
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,560
 I
我

66
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,260
rangers
游骑兵

67
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,300
 hook can be helpful when we want to see which dependencies are being tracked
当我们想查看正在跟踪哪些依赖项时，钩子很有用

68
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,900
 debugging purposes
调试目的

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,320
 also there's on rendered trigger
也有一个渲染触发器

70
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:46,120
 this is called when a new render is triggered allowing you to inspect which dependency triggered a component to re render
当触发新渲染时，将调用此选项，允许您检查哪个依赖项触发了要重新渲染的组件

71
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,460
 as you can imagine this is going to make the bugging a lot easier
你可以想象这会让窃听变得容易得多

72
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,080
 we need to figure out which dependencies
我们需要找出哪些依赖关系

73
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,300
 are being tracked
正在被跟踪

74
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,420
 in which dependencies are triggering our component to re render
其中依赖关系将触发组件重新渲染

75
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,840
 also can be good when we're doing performance optimism
同时当我们做性能优化时很有用

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
 really excited to see what sort of optimization tools can be created
真的很兴奋能看到它们能催生出什么样的优化工具

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
 entering around these hooks
真的很兴奋能看到它们能催生出什么样的优化工具
