1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,980
Aside from improved typescript support
除了改善了typescript支持

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,480
the two reasons we want to use the composition API are
还有我们使用composition API的其他两个原因

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,560
to organize things by feature 
按特性组织内容

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and to make the code reusable across other components
并使代码在其他组件之间可重用

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,280
and right now are sample code doesn't neither
而现在我们的示例代码都没有

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
so let's refactor
所以我们来重构一下

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,110
as if we wanted to make things more modular
我们想要代码更模块化一些

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,000
Here is our current code
这是我们目前的代码

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
this is nothing new based on what we've built
这是我们在之前的代码上写好的

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,100 
However I am now using refs
现在使用的是refs

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,280
because honestly I think it's a little simpler
因为说实话，我觉得refs的使用更简单一点

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,320
To organized the code by feature
为了按功能组织代码

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,420
I would move the code out of the setup method
我会把代码移出setup方法

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
create a new function called useEventSpace
创建一个叫做useEventSpace的函数

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,720
which is our composition function
这是我们的复合函数

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,400
And then call this composition function our setup method
然后从我们的setup方法中调用这个复合函数

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,880
Now our component is organized by feature
我们的组件是按功能组织的

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,001
And if there was additional features I wanted to add 
如果我想添加其他功能

19
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:51,201
I could just start reading another composition function
我可以写另外一个复合函数

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,320
what if I wanted to make this code were reusable across other components
如果我想让跨组件使用代码呢

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,340
To do this, I would move my composition function into another file
为了实现这个,我就把复合函数移到另一个文件中

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,120
Let's put it in the use directory and call it events-sapce.js
把它放入use目录中，event-space.js

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,820
I'll then export this function
然后导出

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,980
and then import into our component
然后引入到我们的组件中

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,440
that's all there is to it
就在这儿这样写

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
What if I wanted to add another composition function
如果我想添加另一个复合函数呢?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,780
inside this component called event mapping
在这个组件里面叫做事件的映射

26
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,700
to map out the location of the event
用来映射标出活动地点

27
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,400
Well, I would just import it
好吧,我会直接引入

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,940
and then inside the setup function you might think that I would just
然后在setup函数中,你也许会认为我会

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,800
call both function
调用这两个函数

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,120
But actually, this isn't valid JavaScript
但实际上这不是有效的js脚本

35
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,920
we can't create objects like this
我们不能创建这样的对象

36
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,620
instead I would restructure the object that each of these return
相反，我会重构这些对象在return中返回

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,200
giving my template access to everything it needs to render
给我的模板访问它需要呈现的一切

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
Our solution is pretty efficient
解决方案相当有效

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,740
But my coding this way we've introduced a problem
但是通过这种方式编码导致了一个新问题

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,000
it's not clear by looking at this file
这些复合函数写的并不是很清晰的注入到哪个文件中

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,300
which objects are being injected by which composition function

43
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,420
this was one of the problems we previously had with Mixin
这个问题和以前Mixin的问题是同样的

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,560
to solve this, we can create local objects
为了解决这个问题,我们可以在当前页面创建一些对象

45
for the data that are composition functions are sending in
所有这些我们可以为合成函数发送的数据创建本地对象

44
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,740
and then use those in the return object
然后在return对象中使用它们

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,600
now it's explicit which objects are coming from which composition function
现在它明确了哪些对象来自哪个组合函数

46
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,880
this is a Vue3.0 best practice
这是Vue3.0 最好的例子
