2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,480
our next few three syntax is best taught by looking at a code example
接下来的三种语法最好通过查看代码示例的方式来学习

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,180
so here you can see we have a template with a search input box
在这里您可以看到我有一个带搜索框的模板

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,800
and when we search
当我们搜索的时候

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,960
we wanted to return the number of event results
想要返回事件结果的数量

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,360
inside the script tag we need to import ref because we'll have some reactive references
在script标签中我们需要导入ref，因为我们会有一些响应式引用

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,860
and we'll import the event API
然后我导入事件相关的API

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,100
this is just a dummy API I threw together for the example
这只是我为了这个例子凑到一块的一个虚拟API

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,900
then inside of our setup method we have our search input and 
然后在我们setup方法中，我们有搜索输入框

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,340
our results for our reactive references 
和搜索结果的响应式引用

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,000
remember we're just returning the number of results not the actual
记住我们只是返回结果的数量，而不是实际结果

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,580
then will call our event API
然后将调用我们event API

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,480
sending in the search input value and returning the results
在输入搜索内容时发送并返回结果

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,240
and then finally since we need these inside of our template
最后，因为我们在模板中需要这些东西

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,100
we'll return both search input
因此我们返回搜索输入框

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,180
and results reactive references
和搜索结果响应式引用

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,260
now if we jump in our browser
现在如果我们打开浏览器

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,620
we'll see that this doesn't work yet
我们会看到还不能正常工作

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,500
not at all the problem is that with our current code
我们当前代码的问题是

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,740
our API call only gets called once when setup is initially run
当setup初次执行时，我们仅调用了一次API

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,420
and we needed to run every time the search input changes
但我们需要在每次搜索输入改变时都调用

27
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,880
this is where we need to use the watch effect syntax
这就是我们需要使用watchEffect语法的地方

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,580
which is new for vue3
这是vue3中的新api

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,640
we'll import it
我们把它导入

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,320
and we'll wrap our code in a callback
然后我们把代码包在一个回调函数里

31
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,120
watchEffect will run this function on next tick
watchEffect将立刻运行此函数

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,460
while reactivity tracking its dependencies
且响应式的追踪其依赖项

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,000
and re running it when its dependencies change
当依赖项更改时变回重新运行回调

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,640
so if we look at our browser now
所以如果我们现在再看浏览器

35
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,480
as we type our number of events gets updated
当我们打字时，我们时间数量会实时更新

37
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,460
you can think of watchEffect
你可以认为watchEffect

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,780
as a simpler version of the watch
是一个更简单的watch版本

39
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,860
function that you might be familiar with from vue2
就是vue2中熟悉的功能

40
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:50,880
we still use the watch function when we want to be specific about what triggers the watcher to run
当我们想具体说明什么东西会触发观察程序重新运行时我们仍然会使用watch函数

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,960
so even if our callback includes other reactive objects
所以即使我们回调函数中还包括其他响应式对象

42
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,100
it won't get called unless search input changes
只要搜索输入内容不变都不会调用

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,160
using watch we can also get access to the new value and old value of the item being watched
我们还可以访问被监视项目的新旧值

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,600
 like you see here
就像你在这里看到的

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,160
 I can watch multiple reactive objects
我可以侦听多个响应式对象

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
by sending an array
通过传递一个数组

47
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,420
and
并且


48
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,040
we can also get access to the new and old values of each of these
您还可以访问这些值的新值和旧值

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
 if we need them in our callback function
如果我们在回调函数中需要它们

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,160
so what might it look like if we use watch instead of watch effect in our example
所以如果在我们的例子中使用watch而不是watchEffect会是什么样子

51
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,620
first we imported
我们首先导入

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,580
then we'll called watch searchInput
然后我们使用watch侦听searchInput

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,940
 because we want to run the callback when search input changes
因为我们希望在搜索输入更改时运行回调

55
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,560
 if we looked at this in the browser
如果我们在浏览器中查看

56
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
 you would notice
你会注意到的

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,540
 number of events starts out as empty
事件数会以空开始

58
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,760
 then it works as we type
然后我们打字的时候又可以了

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,380
it started out as empty because it didn't get run on initial load
一开始是空，因为它没有在初始时运行

60
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,820
 in other words watch
换句话说，watch

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
 is lazy loaded by default
默认为延迟加载

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,280
this might be the functionality you want
可能是你想要的功能

63
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,380
however if you did want to use watch
但是如果你真的想让watch

64
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,760
 have it run on initial load
在初始化时就运行

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
 you can send in the option immediate true
你可以设置immediate选项为true

66
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,700
 run the code immediately and then again when search input changes
代码会立即运行，然后在搜索输入更改时再次运行

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,000
 as you can see here a number of events starts at zero
如您所见，许多事件都是从零开始的

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,260
 as it run initially
就像它最初运行的那样

69
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,320
 and then at works
然后在工作中

70
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,400
 as we expect
如我们期待的那样

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,200
 watch effect
watchEffect

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,660
 only ever takes a single argument which is the call back
只接受一个单独的参数，那就是回调函数

73
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,140
 and watch
watch呢

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,140
 multiple arguments
多个参数

75
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,320
 including
包括

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,880
 reactive object we want to watch
我们要跟踪的响应对象

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,580
 and options
和选项

78
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,060
 we want to configure it
我们要配置它
