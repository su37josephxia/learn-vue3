00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,705
Hi, I'm Gregg Pollack
嗨，我是格雷格·波拉克

2
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:10,530
In this video,
在这个视频中，

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,650
we'll be looking at why the composition API was created for vue3.0
我们将了解为什么要为vue3.0创建组合API

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,614
We'll start by taking a look at the limitations of vue2.0,
我们首先看一下vue2.0的局限性，

5
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:22,510
and then look at how vue3.0 solve these problems for us.
然后看看vue3.0是如何为我们解决这些问题的。

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:27,050
There are three limitations you may run into when using you to create components.
在您创建组件时可能会遇到三个限制。

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,534
The first is as your components grow and get bigger and uglier,
第一个是随着组件增长，它们变得越来越大、越来越丑，

8
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:36,170
they become less readable and therefore less maintainable
因此可读性、可维护性变得更差了

9
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,824
The second is that as you reuse pieces of code across components
第二个问题是，当您跨多个组件重用代码片段时

10
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:43,600
each of these code reuse patterns in Vue2.0 has its drawbacks
Vue2.0中的每种代码重用模式都有其缺点

11
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,720
The 3rd is that Vue2.0, has limited Typescript support.
第三个是Vue2.0对Typescript的支持有限。

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,778
There's ways to write it with Typescript,
有办法用TypeScript来写vue2代码

13
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,610
but they're not completely optimal.
但它们并不是最优的。

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,776
Let's dive into the first limitation,
让我们深入到第一个限制，

15
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:58,550
which is that large components may be hard to read and maintain.
那就是大的组件可能难以阅读和维护。

16
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,798
Let's imagine we're creating a simple search component,
想象一下我们正在创建一个简单的搜索组件，

17
00:01:01,798 --> 00:01:04,350
you know a search bar that looks like this,
你知道一个像这样的搜索栏，

18
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,120
using the regular component syntax,
使用常规组件语法，

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,630
we would create a .vue file which might have a data option with reactive properties.
我们将创建一个.vue文件，它可能有一个带响应式属性的data选项。

20
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,280
And our methods for our search logic.
以及搜索逻辑的方法。

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,705
Once Complete,we realize we need some sorting functionality.
一旦完成，我们意识到我们需要一些排序功能。

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,545
So we write up the code,
所以我们继续堆代码，

23
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,920
which also has some reactive properties and some methods.
它也具有一些响应式属性和方法。

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,493
Our code for each feature, as you can see,is split up between two options.
就像你看到的，每个功能的代码都被分为两个选项。

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,405
Things aren't too messy,but they would be if we added additional functionality for say
事情还不会太混乱，但是如果我们增加额外的功能，比如说

26
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:36,729
search filters and pageination.
搜索过滤和分页。

27
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,870
The problem here is that logical concerns or features
这里的问题是逻辑关系或特性

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,680
are organized by component options.
按组件选项组织。

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,398
And there's a lot of component options in Vue,
Vue中有很多组件选项，

30
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,990
things like components, props, data computed methods,and life cycle.
比如components、props、data、计算属性和生命周期。

31
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,030
Our feature code might be divided up into six different places.
我们的功能代码可能会被分成六个不同的位置。

32
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,390
And if you think about a more complex component,
如果你考虑一个更复杂的组件，

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,290
having our code split up in multiple places
把我们的代码分散在多个地方

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,482
just isn't as nice as having it all organized together,
这肯定不如把它们都组织在一起好，

35
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:05,020
which makes our component more readable and maintainable
这使我们的组件更具可读性和可维护性

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,730
Even in our simple example,
即使在我们这个简单的例子中，

37
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:12,640
it'd be nice if our search code and our sort code was kept together and Vue3.0 makes this possible.
如果我们能把搜索代码和排序代码放在一起也会很好，Vue3.0就能让这成为可能。

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,071
Using the composition API,
使用composition API，

39
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:16,360
we can keep our components more readable.
我们可以让我们的组件更具可读性。

40
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,020
This all starts with the new setup method inside of our components.
这些都是从我们组件新的setup方法开始的。

41
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,000
Inside the new setup function is where we can start using the composition API syntax.
在新的setup函数中，我们可以开始使用Composition API语法。

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,520
And this syntax is completely optional.
这个语法是完全可选的。

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,250
We can still continue to code up components like we have before using the regular syntax.
我们仍然可以使用常规语法继续编写组件。

44
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,380
I knew when I first saw this, I was saying, wait,
我第一次看到这个的时候，我在说，等等，

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,230
does this mean I create a gigantic setup method with a ton of code?
这是否意味着我用大量的代码创建了一个巨大的setup方法？

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,318
And the answer here is now
答案就是现在

47
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:51,110
with Vue3.0，you end up writing composition functions.
使用Vue3.0，你最终会编写合成函数。

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,350
These are outside of your setup method.
这些是在setup方法之外的。

49
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,940
And they could be in the same component file.
它们可能在同一个组件文件中。

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,220
Here you can see I have a use search function and a use sorting function.
这里您可以看到我有一个搜索函数和一个排序函数。

51
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,610
These are called composition functions.
这些被称为复合函数。

52
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,600
And they're called from inside the setup method.
它们从setup方法内部调用。

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,110
As you see here,
如你所见，

54
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,640
Don't worry.
别担心。

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,180
We'll dive into the details of the syntax later.
稍后我们将深入讨论语法的细节。

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:14,738
For now,
就目前而言，

57
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:20,650
just know that our code using composition functions can now be organized by logical concerns.
只要知道我们使用复合函数的代码现在可以通过逻辑关系来组织。

58
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,560
I wanna point out that this doesn't mean our user interface has less components.
我想指出，这并不意味着我们的用户界面有更少的组件。

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm not gonna be writing each piece of my page in different composition functions.
我不会用不同的排版功能来写我的每一页。

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,390
I'm still gonna have multiple components for each part of my user interface.
我还是会有多个组件为我的用户界面的每个部分。

61
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,470
The second limitation of Vue2.0 is that there's no perfect way to reuse code across components.
Vue2.0的第二个限制是，没有完美的方式在组件之间重用代码。

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,360
And Let me show you exactly what I mean.
接下来我来演示一下我的意思。

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,190
Back in our search component,
回到我们的搜索部分，

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,740
there are three ways we could extract this code for reuse using Vue2.0.
有三种方法可以使用Vue2.0提取此代码以供重用。

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,120
The first is Mixins.
首先是Mixins。

66
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,680
With mixins, first we would separate our code.
对于mixins，首先我们要分离代码。

67
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,230
Then we create a productSearchMixin,
然后我们创建一个productSearchMixin，

68
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,810
create a resultSortMixin
创建一个resultSortMixin

69
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,960
and then include the mixin and in our component.
然后将mixin包含在我们的组件中。

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,800
I'll shrink this down for simplicity.
为了简单起见我会缩小范围。

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,220
The good part about this is now our code is organized by feature.
好的部分是现在我们的代码是按特征组织的。

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,284
However,
然而，

73
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:21,580
with Mixins you can end up with property name conflicts.
使用mixins可能会导致属性名称冲突。

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,060
It's not clear if and how these mixins interact.
还不清楚这些mixins是否以及如何交互。

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,980
And We can't easily reuse this code to search and sort different things.
我们不能轻易地重用这些代码来搜索和排序不同的东西。

76
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,630
Like maybe if we had a list of reviews or sellers or shipping options.
比如，如果我们有一张书评、卖家或发货清单。

77
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,950
The second solution we might use with Vue2.0 is by creating a mixin and factory.
Vue2.0可能使用的第二个解决方案是创建一个mixin工厂

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,890
These are functions that return a customized version of a mixin.
这些函数返回mixin的定制版本。

79
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,600
Here you can see we have our searchMixinFactory.
这里您可以看到我们searchMixinFactory。

80
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,600
And Then We have our sortingMixinFactory.
然后我们有我们的sortingMixinFactory。

81
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,690
Then inside of our component, we import these two.
然后在我们的组件中，我们导入这两个。

82
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,630
Then we use each of these mixins specifying a name space,
然后我们使用这些mixin并指定一个命名空间，

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,350
and any configuration we need for each of the factories so that it can sort products.
以及每个工厂需要的配置，以便它可以给产品排序。

84
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,960
Now, the generic parts of search and sorting can be reused.
现在，搜索和排序的通用部分可以被重用了。

85
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,070
We also have clearer relationships with how our features interact.
我们也有这些特性如何互动的更清楚的关系。

86
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,260
However,namespacing requires strong conventions and discipline to do right.
然而，命名空间需要强大的约定和规则来做正确的事。

87
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,360
We still have to look inside each mixin and to see what properties it exposes.
我们仍然需要查看每个mixin的内部，并查看它暴露了哪些属性。

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,950
And mixin and factories can't be dynamically generated.
混合和工厂不能动态生成。

89
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,850
Another solution that solves some of these problems in Vue2.0 are scopes slots. What might that look like?
Vue2.0中解决这些问题的另一个解决方案是作用域插槽。 会是什么样子？

90
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,630
We'll start out with a generic search component.
我们将从通用搜索组件开始。

91
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,160
This has props and it has a slot.
这个有props，还有一个插槽。

92
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,840
Will also have a generic sorting component
还将有一个通用排序组件

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,970
which has crops for configuration and a slot.
其具有配置面板和一个插槽。

94
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,770
Then instead of our search component,
然后取代搜索组件，

95
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,290
we use these components sending in configuration specific product search.
我们使用这些组件发送特定产品搜索配置。

96
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,180
This address is just about every downside of mixins.
这个实现只是避免mixins的缺点。

97
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,841
However, it does increase indentation,
但是，它却增加了代码缺口，

98
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:06,600
which decreases readability.
会降低可读性。

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,017
Some of our configuration ends up in the template,
我们的配置最终出现在模板中，

100
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:11,770
which ideally should just contain what we want to render.
理想情况下应该仅包含我们想要渲染的内容。

101
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,882
Exposed properties like product search are only available
只暴露那些可用的产品搜索属性

102
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:15,715
in the template.
在模板中。

103
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:19,730
And having three instead of one component instance means it's less performance.
而拥有三个而不是一个组件实例意味着它的性能更差。

104
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,900
And those are the three ways you could reuse code with you too.
这三种方式也是你可以重用代码的方法。

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,844
However, in Vue3.0,
然而，在Vue3.0中，

106
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:29,330
we now have composition functions a 4th way to reuse code.
我们现在有了第四种重用代码的方式--组合函数。

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
Like before we have a file for a search functionality
就像之前我们有搜索功能的文件一样

108
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,710
and a file for our sorting functionality.
以及我们分类功能的文件。

109
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,670
These each contain composition functions which have a new syntax we'll get into in later lessons.
这些都包含组合函数，这些函数有一个新的语法，我们将在后面的课程中介绍。

110
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,720
Then inside of our search component,
在我们搜索组件内，

111
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,870
we include these composition functions and use them inside of our setup method,
我们在setup方法中包含并使用这些组合函数，

112
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,920
sending in any configuration they need.
发送他们需要的配置。

113
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,730
This solution uses less code.
此方案使用较少的代码。

114
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,127
It also builds on your existing JavaScript skills.
它还建立在您现有的JavaScript技能之上。

115
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,360
Since you're already familiar with functions,
既然你已经熟悉了函数，

116
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,668
it's much more flexible than mixins and scope slots,
它比混入和作用域插槽更灵活，

117
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,575
censor diss functions, intellisense auto Complete,
代码审查，自动完成

118
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:10,540
and typing likely already work in your code editor.
和输入已经可以在代码编辑器中使用。

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,296
The only downside here is that with Vue3.0,
现在使用vue3唯一的缺点是

120
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:16,970
now there are two different syntax is for defining components.
现在有两种不同的语法用于定义组件。

121
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,440
The regular syntax
常规语法

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,400
and this advanced composition API.
以及这个高级的composition API。

123
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,520
Yeah.
是的。

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,660
Yeah.
是的。

125
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,140
Yeah.
是的。

126
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,280
Should be chilly.
这不太友好

127
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,790
We're more togetherness, togetherness. Separate our
我们更团结，团结。 把我们和mixin分开

128
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,490
with Mixin.

129
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,990
Ah I'm excited. Ah Ooh Yeah.
啊我很兴奋。 啊哦是的。

130
